# Community Structure in Networks

Organizers: 
* Boleslaw Szymanski (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA), 
* Hocine Cherifi (University of Burgundy Franche-Comté, France), 
* Gergely Palla (Eötvös Loránd University, Hungary),
* Péter Pollner (ELKH, Hungary)

Satellite Description: 
Community structure is one of the most relevant features encountered in numerous real-world applications of networked systems. Despite the tremendous effort of a large interdisciplinary community of scientists working on this subject over the past few years to characterize, model, and analyze communities, more investigations are needed in order to better understand the impact of their structure and dynamics on networked systems. Therefore, the primary goal of this satellite workshop is to demonstrate the cutting edge research advances on community structures in networks, in order to provide a landscape of research progresses and application potentials in related areas.

Papers ranging from a broad nature, to various aspects of community structure with strong algorithmic innovations, but also application-oriented works are solicited.

Topics relevant to this satellite session include, but are not limited to, the following:
* Models of Communities
* Evolution of Communities
* Dynamic and/of Communities
* Communities in Multiplex
* Temporal Communities
* Community Detection and Mining
* Evaluation Issues in Community Detection
* Parallel Algorithms for Community Detection
* Communities and Epidemics
* Communities and Rumor Spreading
* Communities and Sampling
* Hierarchy and Ego-Networks
* Communities and Controllability
* Communities and Synchronization
* Communities and Resilience
* Communities and Link prediction
* Visual Representation of Communities
* Communities in Economics & Finance networks
* Communities in Technological Networks
* Communities in Biological and Brain Networks
* Communities in Social Networks
* Communities and Semantic Data
* Communities and Embedding Models
* Communities in Mobile and Wireless Networks
